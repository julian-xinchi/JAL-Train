A simple tool to Draw math function's curve in a GUI

# Revision brief

2023/5/10:

ADD rdc_boxed.exe which can draw curve of sin(2\*pi\*exci_x)\*sin(2\*pi\*sig_x), dll already integrated.

  Four text boxes included:

      Amplitude(0.0\~1.0):

      Excitation waves(10.0\~100.0):  --which means how many periods of excitation waves displayed in the GUI, fractional part supported

      Signal waves(0.5\~5.0):         --which means how many periods of signal waves displayed in the GUI, fractional part supported

      Noise factor(0.0\~0.5)
  
  One "Generate" button included, when press the button, new curve decided by parameters in four text boxes will be draw in GUI.
